## CRITICAL GAPS (Game-Breaking Omissions)

### 1. WEAPON FEEL / GAME JUICE
**Status: SEVERELY LACKING**

Every great FPS has weapons that feel powerful and responsive. Research shows:

> "A strong audio-visual experience is necessary to maintain immersion. Whether a weapon feels good to use has more to do with the SFX and VFX than damage."

**Missing Elements:**
- [ ] **Recoil patterns** - Visual camera kick on firing
- [ ] **Weapon sway** - Idle animation, movement sway
- [ ] **Screen shake on impact** - Both giving and receiving damage
- [ ] **Muzzle flash variation** - Not just particles, actual light emission
- [ ] **Shell casings** - Ejected brass with physics

- [ ] **Enemy stumble on terrain** - Reacting to environment

### 3. PLAYER FEEDBACK LOOP
**Status: INCOMPLETE**

**Missing Elements:**
- [ ] **Hitmarkers** - Visual confirmation of hits (optional toggle)
- [ ] **Critical hit indicators** - Headshot/weak point feedback
- [ ] **Kill confirmation** - Audio/visual for kills
