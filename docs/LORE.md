# STELLAR DESCENT: PROXIMA BREACH — Complete Lore Bible

This document contains the complete narrative, world-building, characters, and story content for the game. It serves as the canonical source for all story-related decisions.

## Setting

### The Year: 3147 CE

One thousand years in the future, humanity has spread beyond Earth. The Solar System is fully colonized, and the first interstellar missions have reached Alpha Centauri.

### The Terran Expansion Authority (TEA)

The governing body overseeing human expansion beyond the Solar System. Part military, part colonial administration, the TEA manages:
- Interstellar colonization missions
- Military protection of colonies
- Resource extraction rights
- Terraforming operations

### Faster-Than-Light Travel

FTL travel exists but is expensive and limited. Colony ships travel at ~0.3c using Alcubierre-derived warp technology. The journey to Proxima Centauri takes approximately 14 years.

### ANCHOR Stations

Mobile deployment platforms positioned in orbit above target worlds. These massive stations (2+ km in length) serve as:
- Staging areas for ground operations
- Command and control centers
- Housing for 4,000+ personnel
- Drop pod launch platforms
- Medical and R&R facilities

## Radio Chatter

### Mission Start
- "Prometheus Actual to Specter. Drop window opens in 30 seconds."
- "Green light confirmed. Godspeed, Sergeant."
- "Telemetry locked. You're cleared for orbital insertion."

### Combat
- "Contact! Hostile signatures inbound!"
- "Specter, be advised - multiple contacts on approach."
- "Prometheus tracking heavy movement in your sector."

### Marcus Lines
- "Hammer here. Good to see you, brother."
- "Watch your six - they come from below."

- "Just like the Europa job, eh James?"

### Victory

## Themes

### Brotherhood
The core emotional thread. James's mission isn't just military - it's personal. His bond with Marcus drives the story.

### Sacrifice
What are you willing to risk for family? For duty? For humanity's future?

### Survival
The hostile environment is as dangerous as the enemies. Kepler's Promise doesn't want humans there.

### The Unknown
We think we know the universe. We're wrong. The Chitin were always there, waiting.

## World Building Notes

### Technology Level
- FTL travel (expensive)
- Advanced AI (not sentient)
- Powered armor
- Combat mechs
- Energy weapons exist but rare
- Conventional firearms still standard

### Social Structure
- Earth still exists, still important
- Mars is the industrial hub
- Outer colonies are frontier
- Military service is respected
- Corporate interests exist but TEA has authority

### What We Don't Know
- Are there other Chitin hives?
- What awakened them specifically?
- Are there other alien species?
- What's in the unexplored southern hemisphere?

These questions are left for potential sequels.
